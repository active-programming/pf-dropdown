PF Dropdown
===========

This is Dropdown, so there is no "tags" feature or something else. The "autocomplete" just is related ability of Dropdown component.

**Note:** You need to have jQuery imported as global object!

*webpack.config.js*
```
    ...
    plugins: [
        new webpack.ProvidePlugin({
            $: 'jquery',
            jQuery: 'jquery'
        }),
    ]
    ...
```

See Demo page from ./demo folder.
